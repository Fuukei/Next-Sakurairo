## Getting Started



### Components
Some components, such as the logo component, can be switched out dynamically. You can identify these components by looking for folders with a _`dynamic.ts`_ file.

The _`dynamic.ts`_ file contains dynamic imports for different versions of a component. The version used by your site is determined by the option field in your configuration file.

To configure for a different component, you need to modify your configuration file (config/index.ts).

Let's take the logo component as an example. If you want to change your logo from TextLogo to ImageLogo, you'd make the following change:
```typescript config/index.ts
export const blogConfig: BlogConfig = {
    // rest of config
    header_logo: {
        option: "ImageLogo",
        settings: {
            image_path: "/logo.png"
        }
    },
    // rest of config
}
```
In this example, we've changed the option field under header_logo from "TextLogo" to "ImageLogo". This tells the blog to use the ImageLogo component instead of the TextLogo component.
