## Getting Started


## Components

### New Component Options

There are 3 steps to create a new component option.

1. Create new component file under _`/components/<component-name>`_
2. Add dynamic import to _`/components/<component-name>/dynamic.ts`_
3. Add new option typing to _`/config/type.ts`_

Let's take a look at existing components under _`/components/logo`_ as an example.

If we want to add ImageLogo.tsx to show an image as logo in the header, we would first create the file _`/components/logo/ImageLogo.tsx`_

```tsx /components/logo/ImageLogo.tsx
import Image from "next/image";

// note this need to be done after the third step is completed
// use placeholders during component development
// mark
const logoSetting = require("@/config").blogConfig.header_logo.settings
// Here, logoHover is needed because it is passed through in Logo.tsx to be used in TextLogo component
// mark[35:67]
export default function ImageLogo({logoHover}: {logoHover: boolean}) {
    return (
        <div className={"h-16"}>
            <Image src={logoSetting.image_path}
                   alt={"logo"}
                   width={0}
                   height={0}
                   sizes="100vw"
                   style={{ width: 'auto', height: '90%' }}
            />
        </div>

    )
}
```

Then we would add the dynamic import to _`/components/logo/dynamic.ts`_

```ts /components/logo/dynamic.ts
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

export const TextLogo = dynamic(() => import('./TextLogo'));
// add new components like this
// mark
export const ImageLogo = dynamic(() => import('./ImageLogo'));
```

Finally, we would add the new option typing to _`/config/type.ts`_

We would add the option and its appropriate settings to _`header_logo`_
```ts /config/type.ts
export type BlogConfig = {
    // Rest of config types
    header_logo:
        | {
        option: "TextLogo";
        settings: {
            // TextLogo Settings
        } }
        // mark(1:5)
        // example for ImageLogo
        | { option: "ImageLogo";
            settings: {
                image_path: string;
            } }
    // Rest of config types
}
```

After types are added, we can use the new option in _`/config/index.ts`_. Any config settings in _`/config/index.ts`_ can be used to import in components. This give the user and developer the flexibility to configure and develop components fitting for their use.

### Enable Config Options for Components

If a component is not in a folder with _`dynamic.ts`_, it means there are no options for it to be configured in the config files.

To make a component configurable, there are 4 steps.

1. Create a new directory under the _`/components`_ with the name of the component.
2. Create the base component file in the new directory.

    Let's use the logo components as an example. The base component file would be _`/components/logo/Logo.tsx`_, it handles importing and displaying the correct logo variant based on the option set in the config file.

```typescript /components/logo/Logo.tsx
import { FC } from 'react';
import * as LogoComponents from '@/components/logo/dynamic';

type LogoOptionKeys = keyof typeof LogoComponents;

const logoOption: LogoOptionKeys = require("@/config").blogConfig.header_logo.option;
const SelectedLogo = LogoComponents[logoOption];

const Logo: FC<{ logoHover: boolean }> = ({ logoHover }) => {
    return <SelectedLogo logoHover={logoHover} />;
};

export default Logo;
```

3. Create _`dynamic.ts`_ in the new directory. This file will be responsible for dynamically importing the appropriate component based on the option set in the config file.
4. To add new component variations, follow the steps in [New Component Options](#new-component-options)
